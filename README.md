INTRINSIC MOTOR NEURONE EXCITABILITY IS REDUCED IN SOLEUS AND TIBIALIS ANTERIOR OF OLDER ADULTS

The present study compared ΔFs to estimate differences in PIC strength of soleus and tibialis anterior motor units between young and older adults. Additionally, we explored the relationship between ΔF and the peak discharge rates.
